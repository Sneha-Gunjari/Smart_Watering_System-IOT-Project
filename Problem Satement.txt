Problem Satement:
Farmers face problem in over watering the crop if they miss switching off the motor, which may lead to crop damage and water wastage.
Solution:
->The Solution is Smart watering System. In this System, the crop is watered according to its requirement, without the farmer. 
->Soil Moisture is detected from the crop. Based on the Moisture percentage, the motor will turn on and off automatically. And this can be visualized by farmer in a app (Blynk IoT). 
->The required moisture for that respective crop acts as the threshold_moisture_value to turn on or turn off the motor.
